1) x&~(x-1) => prints the lsb of x;

2)The xor of numbers upto n can be determined in O(1) by considering the observation that
        a)if(x%4==0) => n
        b)if rem with 4==1 => 1
        c)if rem with 4==2 => x+1;
        d)if rem with 4==3 => 0;

3)if(n+i)==(n^i) => (n&i==0)

4)Given an array of integers, find the minimum xor of a pair of elements of the array.

 => Sort the array in increasing order. Then minimum xor will be xor of a_i and a_i+1 for some i
